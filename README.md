A large JSON file was split into smaller parts using Python, stored locally, and then automatically uploaded to Amazon S3. The data was ingested into Snowflake, where it was flattened and transformed using User-Defined Functions (UDFs). The final structured table in Snowflake was then used for Tableau visualizations and ad-hoc analysis.
